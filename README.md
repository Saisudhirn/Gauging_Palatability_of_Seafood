# Gauging_Palatability_of_Seafood
In this project, I delved into the world of seafood and performed a comprehensive analysis of the different fish species available in the market. Utilizing my technical prowess in data analytics, I visualized the data and examined the linear relationship and correlation between various dimensions to identify the underlying factors that determine delectability. Employing predictive modeling techniques, I developed robust regression models in R and executed statistical analysis to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 86%. This project showcases my expertise in data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.
